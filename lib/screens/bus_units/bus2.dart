// This is a Git operation guide, not code for this file

/*
To remove the latest commit from your branch:

1. Local removal:
   - Use `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to remove the latest commit locally
   - This will delete both the commit and all changes from that commit

2. Remote removal (after local removal):
   - Use `git push --force origin your-branch-name` to update the remote
   - This will overwrite the remote branch with your local branch

Caution:
- This is a destructive operation and will permanently delete changes
- Only use on commits that haven't been pulled by others
- Never force push to shared branches like main/master
